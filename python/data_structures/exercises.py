# Mini Project 1
'''
Manually (without Python) create a project1.txt file with this information:
alpha, This is the text in alpha
beta, This is the text in beta
charlie, This is the text in charlie


Write a function to read data from the project1.txt file.
Create a nested dictionary from it.

Data structure will be:
{project1: {alpha: This is the text in alpha}, beta: This is the text in beta, charlie: This is the text in charlie}}

Using the nested dictionary write a function to create three files like below:

File = alpha.txt
Text = This is the text in alpha

File = beta.txt
Text = This is the text in beta

File = charlie.txt
Text = This is the text in charlie
