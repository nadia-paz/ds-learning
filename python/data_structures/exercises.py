Manually (without Python) create a project1.txt file with this information:
alpha, This is the text in alpha
beta, This is the text in beta

Write a function to read data from the project1.txt file.
Create a nested dictionary from it.

Data structure will be:
{project1: {alpha: This is the text in alpha}, beta: This is the text in beta, charlie: This is the text in charlie}}

Using the nested dictionary write a function to create three files like below:

For the upcoming academic year the Coolcoders University should decide which students will get the scholarships. 
Scholarships are considered to be correctly distributed if 

all best students have it, but not all students in the university do. 

Obviously, only university students should be able to get a scholarship, 
i.e. there should be no outsiders in the list of the students that will get a scholarships.

You are given lists of unique student ids bestStudents, scholarships and allStudents, 
representing ids of the best students, students that will get a scholarship and 
all the students in the university, respectively. Return true if the scholarships are 
correctly distributed and false otherwise.

Your friend has been doodling during the lecture and wrote down several digits in a circle. 
You're wondering if these digits might form the password to your friend's computer. 
You're planning to prank him some time in the future, and hacking into his computer will definitely help. 
If the digits written in the clockwise order indeed form a password, all you need to do is figure out which digit comes in it first.

Given a list of digits as they are written in the clockwise order, find all other combinations the password could possibly have.
